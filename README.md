# fsf_2020_screening_task: Create Lecture Notes and Animations

During the course of this internship, we will be creating lecture notes along with their corresponding animations. The screening task has been divided in two parts.

**Topic:  Linear Algebra.**

**Part 1 *(Writing Style/Efficiency)*:**
- To create <a href="https://github.com/nishanpoojary/fsf_2020_screening_task/blob/main/LinAlg_VectorsAndSpaces.pdf">lecture notes</a> to explain the topic.
- The writing format is to be eloquent in order to explain the topic thoroughly.

**Part 2 *(Numerical Computation)*:**
- This task was test the numerical computation ability using numpy (and Python). Based on topic selected, we had to complete the relevant task:
- #### Linear Algebra
1. Perform at least 5 <a href="https://github.com/nishanpoojary/fsf_2020_screening_task/blob/main/LinAlg_AdvancedOperations_python.ipynb">advanced linear algebra operations</a> using Numpy and plot them using Matplotlib.
2. Plot the new basis for a 2D matrix.
